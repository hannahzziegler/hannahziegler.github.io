            <ul>
                <li>
                    My editor floated the idea of making a Barron’s story out of the sky-high prices consumers were
                    seeing for sriracha last summer. From that point, my summer revolved around knowing everything about
                    the chili pepper industry. I spoke with academics who have studied industry dynamics for their
                    entire careers, companies like Huy Fong and McCormick who have financial stakes in the industry’s
                    success and multiple real chili pepper farmers in the American southwest — one of whom became the
                    focal point of the story. I spent more than a month on this article during my summer internship at
                    Barron's.

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I pitched this story after Mattel’s stock price began to soar ahead of the “Barbie” movie premiere.
                    I spoke with analysts, combed through previous company financials and worked closely with the
                    managing editor at Barron’s to utilize the Bloomberg Terminal to aid my reporting process. This
                    article led the Barron’s homepage during the “Barbie” movie’s opening weekend.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This story was my first to appear in the weekly Barron's magazine. It resulted from abysmal opening
                    weekends for many of the summer's biggest blockbuster films. Those box office failures shook
                    analysts’ confidence that studios will hit their revenue targets. That made me want to answer the
                    question: could this be the downfall of the big summer blockbuster?

                    movie release. Before the call, each of my journalistic passions collided. I combed through previous

                    I reported this article as a dive into the top industries and companies that perpetuate junk fees –

                    vacation rentals and other services. I combed through dozens of corporate financial reports to
                    understand which companies were the biggest culprits of these hidden fees.

                    prevalence of maternal mortality and later abortions in Georgia during that time.</li>
                <li> I wrote four drafts of this story and edited it meticulously before it appeared in a Sunday A1

                <h5>As GRE comes under fire nationwide, UMD community members voice concerns | <em>Jan. 31, 2022</em>

                <li>This article dives into the struggles many graduate students face in completing the Graduate Record
                    Examination, or GRE. For decades, the GRE served as a cornerstone of the graduate school admissions
                    process. But after numerous studies showing little correlation between GRE scores and student
                    performance, and mounting concerns that the test puts some underrepresented students at a
                    disadvantage, a wave of graduate schools across the nation have dropped the test as an admissions
                    requirement in the last five years. The story covered some graduate students' push for similar
                    changes at the University of Maryland.</li>
