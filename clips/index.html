                <h5>Skateboarding community fights to preserve DC's Freedom Plaza | <em>April 22, 2022</em></h5>
            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>For this story, I spoke with dozens of skateboarders who have spent countless nights shredding
                    across
                    the
                    marble pavement of Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. The
                    skaters, who describe the plaza as the "skateboarding mecca" of the world, united in defense of it
                    when
                    the
                    National Capital Planning Commission outlined a plan in February that would reroute traffic through
                    the
                    space. This is my favorite story that I have ever written. </li>

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>I pitched, reported and wrote this story on the rich ties that two students at the University of
                    Maryland have to a cart in Bethesda, Md. that has been selling shave ice for more than 20 years. The
                    community that the original owner built prompted these students to buy the company themselves.</li>

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>Student leaders at my university organized a campus-wide protest last year after widespread sexual
                    assault allegations were leveraged against a campus fraternity. After the university president said
                    the school's Greek life system does not “have a big problem” with sexual assault, more than 200
                    students marched through campus sharing their stories of harassment. </li>

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>This story covers the climate change perspectives that ten gubernatorial candidates shared during a
                    forum in early 2022 ahead of Maryland's primary elections. I attended the forum and turned around
                    this story in about 30 minutes afterward. </li>

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>This story covers how student climate activists at the University of Maryland wrote their own bill
                    and
                    presented it to the Maryland General Assembly. I pitched, reported and wrote this story about the
                    student-driven FUTURE
                    Act, which would require all state public universities to be carbon neutral by 2035 if passed.</li>

            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>I worked for more than a month to pitch, report and edit this story during my summer 2022 internship
                    at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, working closely with the paper’s senior enterprise editor
                    throughout the process. </li>
                <li>For two weeks, I sifted through archives of Atlanta Journal and Atlanta Constitution articles from
                    the last time abortion was banned in the state before the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade
                    decision. </li>
                <li>I reached out to more than 30 sources who had firsthand knowledge of living in Georgia before Roe v.
                    Wade, historians who have studied late 1960s Georgia history and epidemiologists who studied the
                    prevalence of maternal mortality and later abortions in Georgia during that time.</li>
                <li> I wrote four drafts of this story and edited it meticulously before it appeared in a Sunday A1
                    package of abortion coverage after the state’s 6-week abortion ban went into effect.</li>
