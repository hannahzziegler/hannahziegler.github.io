            <ul>
                <li>
                    My editor floated the idea of making a Barron’s story out of the sky-high prices consumers were
                    seeing for sriracha last summer. From that point, my summer revolved around knowing everything about
                    the chili pepper industry. I spoke with academics who have studied industry dynamics for their
                    entire careers, companies like Huy Fong and McCormick who have financial stakes in the industry’s
                    success and multiple real chili pepper farmers in the American southwest — one of whom became the
                    focal point of the story. I spent more than a month on this article during my summer internship at
                    Barron's.

                    I pitched this story after Mattel’s stock price began to soar ahead of the “Barbie” movie premiere.
                    I spoke with analysts, combed through previous company financials and worked closely with the
                    managing editor at Barron’s to utilize the Bloomberg Terminal to aid my reporting process. This
                    article led the Barron’s homepage during the “Barbie” movie’s opening weekend.

                <li>
                    This story was my first to appear in the weekly Barron's magazine. It resulted from abysmal opening
                    weekends for many of the summer's biggest blockbuster films. Those box office failures shook
                    analysts’ confidence that studios will hit their revenue targets. That made me want to answer the
                    question: could this be the downfall of the big summer blockbuster?

                    This report was my first time diving into earnings season coverage – and I absolutely loved it. I
                    wrote the second quarter earnings story for Mattel, a company I covered often ahead of the “Barbie”
                    movie release. Before the call, each of my journalistic passions collided. I combed through previous
                    financial reports, cold-called analysts and turned around my first update in less than 10 minutes.

                <li>I reached out to more than 30 sources who had firsthand knowledge of living in Georgia before Roe v.
                    Wade, historians who have studied late 1960s Georgia history and epidemiologists who studied the
                    prevalence of maternal mortality and later abortions in Georgia during that time.</li>
                <li> I wrote four drafts of this story and edited it meticulously before it appeared in a Sunday A1

                    the
                    roughly 38 percent jump in the cost of a University of Maryland student health insurance
                    plan was
                    the largest coverage cost increase in a decade and had a massive impact on international
                    students.

                <h5>Later abortion clinic to open in College Park this fall | <em>Aug. 31, 2022</em></h5>

            <ul>
                <li>This local reporting highlights two medical professionals who chose to open a later abortion
                    facility in College Park, Maryland two months after the Supreme Court overturned its
                    landmark Roe v.
                    Wade decision. The clinic is one of only a handful of abortion facilities in the nation that
                    prioritizes care for later abortions and is steps away from the University of Maryland
                    campus.

                <li>For this story, I spoke with dozens of skateboarders who have spent countless nights
                    shredding
                    across
                    the
                    marble pavement of Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. The
                    skaters, who describe the plaza as the "skateboarding mecca" of the world, united to defend
                    it
                    when
                    the
                    National Capital Planning Commission outlined a plan in February 2022 that would reroute
                    traffic
                    through
                    the
                    space. This is my favorite story that I have ever written. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>I hopped onto breaking news coverage with The Diamondback's news editor, Akshaj, during
                    spring break
                    to take
                    our readers behind the hazing allegations that caused the university to suspend
                    Greek life activities for three weeks. Our news editor
                    wrote the lede and top half of the story while I rounded out the nutgraph and filed the
                    bottom half.
                    We got this story published within an hour of getting the court filings.</li>
