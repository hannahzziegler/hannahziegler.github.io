            <h5>For transfer students, housing problems amplify stressful transition to UMD</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>My analysis of university data obtained through two Maryland Public Information Act requests found that
                less than 5 percent of students in our university's housing system across the last five years have been
                transfer students. I found
                students impacted by the issue of housing affordability for late-admit transfers and built the story
                around the data and their anecdotes. </li>

            <h5>The FUTURE Act calls for Maryland public universities to be carbon neutral</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>This story covers how student climate activists at the University of Maryland wrote their own bill and
                presented it to the Maryland General Assembly. I pitched, reported and wrote this story about the
                student-driven FUTURE
                Act, which would require all state public universities to be carbon neutral by 2035 if passed.</li>

            <h5>As GRE comes under fire nationwide, UMD community members voice concerns</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>As the student admissions and financial aid reporter for The Diamondback, I got to learn a lot about
                higher education standardized testing policy. This story allowed me to use my beat coverage to point out
                an issue within our graduate school admissions process and reignited talks to abolish the GRE at the
                University of Maryland.</li>

            <h5>Maryland lawmakers, advocates push for ban on unregistered ghost guns</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>This was a breaking story that resulted from protests at the Maryland State House to ban the sale of
                unregistered and untraceable ghost guns. I researched the issue and interviewed with politicians,
                activists and students involved. </li>
        </ul>

        <a class="clips-links" href="https://dbknews.com/2021/12/14/umd-black-student-enrollment-prince-georges-county/"
            target="_blank">
            <h5>UMD sees small rise in enrollment for Black freshmen from Prince George’s County</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>I filed two Maryland Public Information Act requests to report this story our university's
                progress toward doubling Black student enrollment from Prince George's County by
                2025 – a demand that Black students the university made in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. My
                data analysis found that the university had only enrolled two more Black
                students from Prince George's County between fall 2020 and fall 2021.</li>
        </ul>

            <h5>UMD student and his brother bring Clayboys Shave Ice to College Park</h5>
        </a>
        <ul>
            <li>I pitched, reported and wrote this story on the rich ties that two students at the University of
                Maryland have to a cart in Bethesda, Md. that has been selling shave ice for more than 30 years. The
                community that the original owner built prompted these students to buy the company themselves. This is
                one of my favorite pieces I've ever written.</li>
