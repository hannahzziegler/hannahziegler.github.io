            <ul>
                <li>
                    My editor floated the idea of making a Barron’s story out of the sky-high prices consumers were
                    seeing for sriracha last summer. From that point, my summer revolved around knowing everything about
                    the chili pepper industry. I spoke with academics who have studied industry dynamics for their
                    entire careers, companies like Huy Fong and McCormick who have financial stakes in the industry’s
                    success and multiple real chili pepper farmers in the American southwest — one of whom became the
                    focal point of the story. I spent more than a month on this article during my summer internship at
                    Barron's.

                    I pitched this story after Mattel’s stock price began to soar ahead of the “Barbie” movie premiere.
                    I spoke with analysts, combed through previous company financials and worked closely with the
                    managing editor at Barron’s to utilize the Bloomberg Terminal to aid my reporting process. This
                    article led the Barron’s homepage during the “Barbie” movie’s opening weekend.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This story was my first to appear in the weekly Barron's magazine. It resulted from abysmal opening
                    weekends for many of the summer's biggest blockbuster films. Those box office failures shook
                    analysts’ confidence that studios will hit their revenue targets. That made me want to answer the
                    question: could this be the downfall of the big summer blockbuster?

                    This report was my first time diving into earnings season coverage – and I absolutely loved it. I
                    wrote the second quarter earnings story for Mattel, a company I covered often ahead of the “Barbie”
                    movie release. Before the call, each of my journalistic passions collided. I combed through previous
                    financial reports, cold-called analysts and turned around my first update in less than 10 minutes.

                <li>I reached out to more than 30 sources who had firsthand knowledge of living in Georgia before Roe v.
                    Wade, historians who have studied late 1960s Georgia history and epidemiologists who studied the
                    prevalence of maternal mortality and later abortions in Georgia during that time.</li>
                <li> I wrote four drafts of this story and edited it meticulously before it appeared in a Sunday A1

                <li>This story covers the climate change perspectives that ten gubernatorial candidates shared
                    during a
                    forum in early 2022 ahead of Maryland's primary elections. I attended the forum and turned
                    around
                    this story in about 45 minutes afterward. </li>

                <li>This story covers how student climate activists at the University of Maryland wrote their
                    own bill
                    and
                    presented it to the Maryland General Assembly. I pitched, reported and wrote this story
                    about the
                    student-driven FUTURE
                    Act, which would require all state public universities to be carbon neutral by 2035 if
                    passed.</li>

                <li>After numerous studies showed little correlation between GRE scores and
                    student
                    performance, a wave of graduate schools across the country dropped the test as an
                    admissions
                    requirement in the last five years. The story covered some graduate students' push for
                    similar
                    changes at the University of Maryland.</li>
