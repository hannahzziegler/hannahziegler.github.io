Table of trends in flow-normalized load from the Chesapeake Bay River Input Monitoring stations.,

Key to column headings:,
STAID=USGS Station ID,
STNAM:=Station name,
PCODE=Parameter code:,
,P00600 = Total nitrogen(as N)
,P00631 = Nitrate (as N)
,P00665 = Total phosphorus (as P)
,P00671 = Orthophosphorus (as P)
,P80154 = Suspended sediment
START_YEAR = First water year of modeling period used to estimate load,
END_YEAR = Last water year of modeling period used to estimate load,
"Trend Period = Length of period over which trend is computed, in years, through 2017.",
"Lower Confidence Interval, Change in Load = Lower confidence limit (90%) of the estimated change in load, in 10^6 kilograms per year (kg/yr)",
"Estimated Change in Load = Estimate of flow-normalized load change in Trend Period, in 10^6 kilograms per year (kg/yr)",
"Upper Confidence Interval, Change in Load = Upper confidence limit (90%) of the estimated change in load, in 10^6 kilograms per year (kg/yr)",
"Change in Load, in Percent = Total change in flow-normalized load in percent.",
"Direction of Change in Load = Trend direction, with 3 categories: No Trend, Degrading, Improving",
"Likelihood that Load is Changing = Likelihood of trend direction, with 4 categories: as Likely as Not (likelihood coef, >0.33 and <0.67), Likely (likelihood coef, >=0.67 and <0.90), Very Likely (likelihood coef, >=0.90 and <0.95), Extremely Likely (likelihood coef, >=0.95 and <=1.0)",
,

"Nutrient and suspended-sediment concentrations and loads and flow-normalized concentrations and loads were estimated using a weighted regression approach called Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) (Hirsch and others, 2010), which is included in the R (version 3.4.0) software package called EGRET - Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends (version 2.6.0) (Hirsch and DeCicco, 2015). The uncertainty associated with the trends of nutrient and sediment loads was estimated using the R package called EGRETci (version 1.0.2) ('ci' stands for confidence intervals) (Hirsch and others, 2015).  The application of WRTDS to generate the results provided in this table is documented in Chanat and others, 2016."
